Digilent Adept Runtime for Linux Change Log
===========================================

Adept Runtime for Linux 2.16.5 (03/17/2016):
    1. Fixed a bug that may have prevented proper library initialization on
       some distributions. The only distribution know to be affected by
       this bug is Redhat 5.9.
    2. Added the ability to configure the XC7A15T (Cmod A7). This part may
       now be configured using the "djtgcfg" application.

Adept Runtime for Linux 2.16.4 (01/21/2016):
    1. Modified JTSC to add support for .bin files when configuring an FPGA
       target. The "djtgcfg" application, which is part of the Adept
       Utilities Suite, will now accepts bin files (bitstreams that lack
       the normal Xilinx header) and use them to configure the target FPGA.

Adept Runtime for Linux 2.16.1 (10/02/2014):
    1. Changed the default installation location of libraries from
       "/usr/local/lib/digilent/adept" to "/usr/lib/digilent/adept".
    2. Changed the default installation location of data files from
       "/usr/local/share/digilent/data" to
       "/usr/share/digilent/adept/data".
    3. Changed the default installation location of system binaries from
       "/usr/local/sbin" to "/usr/sbin".
    4. Added the ability to configure the XC7A35T (Basys 3), XC7A100T
       (Nexys 4), XC7A200T (Atlys 2), XC7K325T (Genesys 2), XC7Z010 (Zybo),
       and XC7Z020 (Zed). These parts may now be configured using the
       "djtgcfg" application.
    5. Fixed a bug that caused the JTAG-HS2 and JTAG-SMT2 to ocasionally
       output the wrong sequence on the TMSC and TCKC pins when DjtgEscape
       was called.
    6. Updated Nexys 3, Atlys, Electronics Explorer, FMC Carrier S6, and
       NetFPGA-1G-CML firmware to fix a bug that caused those devices to
       stop responding when the USB cable was disconnected and reconnected
       without power cycling the board.

Adept Runtime for Linux 2.15.9 (03/03/2014):
    1. Added the ability to specify the path Digilent data directory using
       the "DIGILENT_DATA_DIR" environment variable. If this environment
       variable is set then the Runtime will not attempt to parse the path
       to the data directory from the Adept Runtime Configuration File and
       will function properly even if the configuration file isn't present.

Adept Runtime for Linux 2.15.3 (01/20/2014):
    1. Fixed bug that could result in an available interface failing to be
       locked.

Adept Runtime for Linux 2.15.2 (01/03/2014):
    1. Modified the implementation of the data transport protocol used by
       certain devices (Basys, Nexys 2, Nexys 3, Atlys, Genesys, JTAG-USB
       Cable, and Electronics Explorer) to reduce CPU utilization.
    2. Updated JTAG-USB Cable firmware to fix a bug that previously
       resulted in the device's JTAG port becoming inaccessible after an
       application crash while the port was enabled.
    3. Increased the default transaction timeout from 10 seconds to 30
       seconds.

Adept Runtime for Linux 2.15.1 (11/27/2013):
    1. Added the ability to enable error logging by setting the
       "ADEPT_RT_LOGDETAIL" environment variable to a value greater than
       or equal to '1'. Presently all values greater than '0' result in the
       same output to the log file. Future revision may include the ability
       to output additional debug information by setting different error
       levels.
    2. Added the ability to specify the path to the error log file by
       setting the "ADEPT_RT_LOGFILE" environment variable. If error
       logging is enabled and the path has been specified then any errors
       that occur will be logged to the specified file. If error logging is
       enabled and the "ADEPT_RT_LOGFILE" environment variable has not been
       set then any errors that occur will be logged to a file named
       "DebugErc.log", which will be created under the application's
       current working directory.
    3. Modified the Runtime libraries such that initialization errors no
       longer cause LoadLibrary/dlopen to return an error or the
       application to exit. If an initializatoin error occurs then an error
       code is set and the Runtime is marked as uninitialized. Any attempt
       to call a Runtime function results in FALSE being returned. The
       application may determine the cause of the error by calling the
       DmgrGetLastError function. An error code and and description will
       also be output the error log, provided that logging is enabled.
    4. Modified the Runtime libraries such that the ftdi_sio driver is no
       longer detached from Digilent USB devices the first time the
       libraries are loaded into memory. Setting environment variable
       "ADEPT_NO_KRNDRV_DETACH" no longer has any effect on functionality.
    5. Modified the way that device locking is implemented in order to fix
       a bug that could cause an on-going data transfer to fail in
       multi-applicaton environments. Due to the requirements of this
       modification CentOS 4 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 are no longer
       supported.

Adept Runtime for Linux 2.15.0 (09/11/2013):
    1. Extended the DJTG API set to include the following functions:
       DjtgGetGpioMask, DjtgSetGpioDir, DjtgGetGpioDir, DjtgSetGpioState,
       and DjtgGetGpioState. Please note that not all of Digilent's
       programming solutions support these functions.
    2. Added support for DjtgGetGpioMask, DjtgSetGpioDir, DjtgGetGpioDir,
       DjtgSetGpioState, and DjtgGetGpioState to JTAG-SMT2 firmware.
    3. Added support for DjtgBatch commands jcbGetGpioMask, jcbSetGpioDir,
       jcbGetGpioDir, jcbSetGpioState, and jcbGetGpioState to JTAG-SMT2
       firmware.

Adept Runtime for Linux 2.14.3 (08/21/2013):
    1. Removed libusb 1.0.9 dependency to improve compatibility with older
       distributions
    2. Added the ability to prevent the Adept Runtime from attempting to
       detach the ftdi_sio driver when the libraries are first loaded into
       memory by setting the environment variable
       "ADEPT_NO_KRNDRV_DETACH=1". For more information please see the
       "Known Issues" section of the README file.

Adept Runtime for Linux 2.13.1 (04/19/2013):
    1. Modified "52-digilent-usb.rules" and "install.sh" such that ":=" is
       used instead of "=" when assigning MODE permissions. Using the ":="
       syntax prevents other UDEV rule files from changing the permissions
       that are set for Digilent USB devices. This should prevent the need
       to modify "52-digilent-usb.rules" or any other UDEV rule files after
       installation.
    2. Internally modified the way that device enumeration is performed to
       fix a bug that could cause an on-going data transfer in one process
       to fail when another process performed enumeration. This bug
       affected the JTAG-HS1, JTAG-HS2, JTAG-SMT1, JTAG-SMT2, Zed,
       JTAG-ONSB1, JTAG-ONB2, JTAG-ONB3, and JTAG-ONB4. Previously it was
       possible to observe such failures by performing device enumeration
       in ChipScope while iMPACT was in the middle of performing indirect
       programming of flash memory.

Adept Runtime for Linux 2.12.1 (02/22/2013):
    1. Changed the way that the ftdi_sio driver is detached from devices.
       All previous versions of the Adept Runtime detached the driver from
       all interfaces (channels) of a Digilent device when it was connected
       to the host. This version of Adept Runtime only detaches the driver
       for interfaces (channels) that aren't configured to use the Virtual
       Comm Port (VCP) driver. This allows users to access the JTAG scan
       chain and VCP of the Anvyl simultaneously.

Adept Runtime for Linux 2.11.2 (01/10/2013):
    1. Modified the data transport protocol used by certain devices
       (JTAG-HS1, JTAG-HS2, JTAG-SMT1, JTAG-SMT2, Zed, JTAG-ONB1,
       JTAG-ONB2, JTAG-ONB3, JTAG-ONB4) to improve performance and reduce
       CPU utilization.

Adept Runtime for Linux 2.11.1 (12/19/2012):
    1. Extended the DJTG API set to include the following functions:
       DjtgBatch, DjtgGetBatchProperties, and DjtgSetAuxReset. Please note
       that not all of Digilent's programming solutions support these
       functions.

Adept Runtime for Linux 2.10.4 (11/13/2012):
    1. Added support for new USB devices: JTAG-ONB2, JTAG-ONB3, and
       JTAG-ONB4.

Adept Runtime for Linux 2.10.3 (08/15/2012):
    1. Added the ability to place the Adept Runtime Configuration File in a
       user specified location. The path to the configuration file may now
       be specified using the "DIGILENT_ADEPT_CONF" or
       "XLNX_DIGILENT_ADEPT_CONF" environment variables. If neither of
       these environment variables specify a path for the configuration
       file then the Runtime attemps to open and parse
       "/etc/digilent-adept.conf" as the configuration file.
    2. Modified install script to no longer required superuser (root)
       privileges for installation.
    3. Modified install script to prompt for location in which the Adept
       Configuration file is installed when the script isn't execute in
       silent mode.

Adept Runtime for Linux 2.10.2 (07/12/2012):
    1. Added support for IEEE 1149.7-2009 by extending the DJTG API set to
       include the following functions: DjtgSetScanFormat,
       DjtgGetScanFormat, DjtgSetReadyCnt, DjtgGetReadyCnt,
       DjtgSetDelayCnt, DjtgGetDelayCnt, DjtgCheckPacket, and DjtgEscape.
       Please note that not all of Digilent's programming solutions are
       capable of interfacing with IEEE 1149.7-2009 targets.
    2. Added IEEE 1149.7-2009 for the JTAG-HS2 and JTAG-SMT2.
    3. Modified the UDEV rules file ("52-digilent-usb.rules") to use the
       "ATTR{}" syntax for matching SYSFS attributes. Previously the
       "SYSFS{}" syntax was used for matching SYSFS attributes, which
       resulted in users being required to have superuser privileges when
       accessing Digilent USB devices on distributions running UDEV version
       174 or newer (Fedora 17 and Ubuntu 12.04). While not officially
       supported, this version of the Adept Runtime for Linux has been
       confirmed to work with Fedora 17 and Ubuntu 12.04.
    4. Modified install script ("install.sh") to detect which version of
       UDEV is installed and install a UDEV rules file that uses the
       "SYSFS{}" syntax for matching SYSFS attributes when appropriate
       (UDEV versions prior to 098).

Adept Runtime for Linux 2.9.9 (04/06/2012):
    1. Fixed a bug that caused a segfault under distributions running
       Kernel 3. While not officially supported, the Adept Runtime for
       Linux has been confirmed to work with Fedora 16 and Ubuntu 11.10
       after this bugfix was implemented.

Adept Runtime for Linux 2.9.8 (03/29/2012):
    1. Fixed a bug that was preventing multiple users from opening a handle
       to the same device.

Adept Runtime for Linux 2.9.7 (03/27/2012):
    1. Fixed a bug that caused inconsistent behavior while using GDB to
       debug applications that were linked against the Runtime.

Adept Runtime for Linux 2.9.6 (03/09/2012):
    1. Added support for new USB devices: JTAG-HS2, JTAG-SMT2, and ZED.
    
Adept Runtime for Linux 2.9.5 (02/17/2012):
    1. Fixed a bug in install script that was causing the UDEV rules not to
       be installed under distributions running Kernel 3.
